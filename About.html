	<h1>I've been asked</h1>
	<center><div class="line"></div></center>
	<center><p>...why I code. Why do I spend endless hours in another world rather than living mine. The truth is, I am living my life. I want to create something that will help millions if not billions of people. I've met very interesting and amazing people with whom I collaborate with rather than compete with. I see extraordinary technology that I wouldn't see otherwise. I want to prove my parents and friends wrong, I want to create code that spreads love and joy rather than hate and sadness. I read an interesting article the other day about a man who would ingest snake venom which was difficult on his body every day for a couple years and then would become immune to a snake's bite. I'm going to be put down every day, but I want to reach the light at the end of the tunnel. Stay Creative. Stay Curious</p></center>

		<h1>FAQ</h1>
		<center><h2>- Where do I want to work in the future?</h2>
		<h3>I like the small company environment and I've recently had my eye on Quizlet. The reason I want to work there is because they have an amazing web development team and I love the contribution Quizlet does towards education</h3>
		<h2>- What is your favorite city?</h2>
		<h3>My absolute favorite city has to be New York City. I remember when I first visited the city (coming from a small town) I was in awe at how colorful and diverse the city was. To this day, it has been my dream destination for work because there is so much to do there; you never get bored!</h3>
		<h2>- What is you favorite color?</h2>
		<h3>Brown, I just think it's a very modern color.</h3>
		<h2>- Why do you love web design?</h2>
		<h3>I've never been good at art or drawing. When I'm coding, the browser is my canvas and I feel more creative and free when doing web design</h3>
		<h2>- Pancakes or Waffles?</h2>
		<h3>Is that even a question? Pancakes of course!</h3></center>
